						The Election Commission ordered a probe into alleged irregularities in electoral rolls in Madhya Pradesh on Sunday after a delegation of Congress leaders led by Kamal Nath and Jyotiraditya Scindia met the commission claiming that there are at least 60 lakh bogus voters listed in the State.
					</p>
					<p>
						Madhya Pradesh has total 5 crore voters so if the Congress claims are true that makes 12 per cent of these voters bogus. The difference in vote share between Congress and BJP in the last assembly elections was merely 8.5 per cent. The assembly elections will held in November this year.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Congress submitted evidence to back their claims to the Election Commission. At a press conference held later, Mr. Nath and Mr. Scindia showed many examples of how many of the voters appear multiple times. For example, a woman voter in Bhojpur constituency of Madhya Pradesh has been listed 26 times in different polling booths within the constituency.
					</p>
					<p>
						“We have provided evidence to the Election Commission that there are approximately 60 lakh fake voters registered in the voting list. These are not merely mistakes. The lists have been deliberately altered at the behest of BJP government in the State,” Mr. Nath said.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Congress investigated at least 101 constituencies where it found 24.65 lakh duplicate voters. There is also gross in discrepancy in the growth of population in the State versus increase in number of voters. “This has been done by BJP. How is it possible that population increased by 24 per cent in 10 years but number of voters increased by 40 per cent?” Mr. Scindia said.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Congress delegation demanded that strict disciplinary action including barring them from conducting elections for 10 years should be taken against officers who are found guilty of tinkering with the list.
					</p>
					<p>
						Explaining the details Mr Scindia said, “Many voters have been listed in the same polling booth multiple times. There is a second category where the same voters are part of multiple polling booths. The third category is where we saw the same name getting repeated in different constituencies too.”
					</p>
					<p>
						Hours after the Congress delegation’s visit, the Election Commission formed two teams to probe the allegations. The teams will have to submit the final report by June 7.
					</p>
					<p>
						“If a deliberate mistake is detected, the responsibility shall be fixed so as to initiate appropriate action,” the EC has noted in its order. It has also asked its officials to assess the status of field verification related to demographically similar entries in the electoral rolls.
